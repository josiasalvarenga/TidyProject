# TidyProject
Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.
##
## Files submitted:
* CodeBook.md - A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data.
* run_analysis.R - One R script that performs the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

* tidy_set.txt - TXT file with the result of all the cleaning made to the original data
